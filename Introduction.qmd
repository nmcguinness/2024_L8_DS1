## Lecture Objectives

- Understand the basics of Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
- Learn the fundamentals of SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Explore how RDBMS and SQL are used in game and software development

## What is RDBMS?

- **RDBMS** stands for *Relational Database Management System*
- A database management system based on the relational model
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server
- Key Features:
  - Data stored in **tables** 
  - Data manipulation using **SQL**
  - Ensures **data integrity** and **security**
  - Supports **ACID** properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

## Key Terms in RDBMS

- **Table**: A collection of related data entries and consists of columns and rows.
- **Row/Record**: A single, implicitly structured data item in a table.
- **Column/Field**: A set of data values of a particular type.
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: A field in a table that links to a primary key in another table.
- **Normalization**: The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy.

## Example - Users Table 

| UserID | Username       | Email                      | PasswordHash                        | DateCreated         |
|--------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|

## Structure - Users Table

| Column Name    | Data Type     | Constraints     |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| UserID         | INT           | PRIMARY KEY     |
| Username       | VARCHAR(50)   | NOT NULL        |
| Email          | VARCHAR(100)  | NOT NULL        |
| PasswordHash   | VARCHAR(255)  | NOT NULL        |
| DateCreated    | DATETIME      | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP |

  - Data Control: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`

## SQL Syntax Basics

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
UPDATE table_name  
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
